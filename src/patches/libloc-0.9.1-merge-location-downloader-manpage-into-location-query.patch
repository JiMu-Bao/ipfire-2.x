-
-== SYNOPSIS

-
-== COMMANDS
-
-'update'::
-	This command will try to update the local database.
-	+
-	It will terminate with a return code of zero if the database has been

-
-== HOW IT WORKS
-The downloader checks a DNS record for the latest version of the database.
-It will then try to download a file with that version from a mirror server.

-have found a file that is recent enough.
