# Flow settings:
# By default, the reserved memory (memcap) for flows is 32MB. This is the limit
# for flow allocation inside the engine. You can change this value to allow
# more memory usage for flows.
# The hash-size determine the size of the hash used to identify flows inside
# the engine, and by default the value is 65536.
# At the startup, the engine can preallocate a number of flows, to get a better
# performance. The number of flows preallocated is 10000 by default.
# emergency-recovery is the percentage of flows that the engine need to
# prune before unsetting the emergency state. The emergency state is activated
# when the memcap limit is reached, allowing to create new flows, but
# prunning them with the emergency timeouts (they are defined below).
# If the memcap is reached, the engine will try to prune flows
# with the default timeouts. If it doens't find a flow to prune, it will set
# the emergency bit and it will try again with more agressive timeouts.
# If that doesn't work, then it will try to kill the last time seen flows
# not in use.
# The memcap can be specified in kb, mb, gb.  Just a number indicates it's

# Specific timeouts for flows. Here you can specify the timeouts that the
# active flows will wait to transit from the current state to another, on each
# protocol. The value of "new" determine the seconds to wait after a hanshake or
# stream startup before the engine free the data of that flow it doesn't
# change the state to established (usually if we don't receive more packets
# of that flow). The value of "established" is the amount of
# seconds that the engine will wait to free the flow if it spend that amount
# without receiving new packets or closing the connection. "closed" is the
# amount of time to wait after a flow is closed (usually zero). "bypassed"
# timeout controls locally bypassed flows. For these flows we don't do any other
# tracking. If no packets have been seen after this timeout, the flow is discarded.
#
# There's an emergency mode that will become active under attack circumstances,
# making the engine to check flow status faster. This configuration variables
# use the prefix "emergency-" and work similar as the normal ones.

## Performance tuning and profiling
##

# The detection engine builds internal groups of signatures. The engine
# allow us to specify the profile to use for them, to manage memory on an
# efficient way keeping a good performance. For the profile keyword you
# can use the words "low", "medium", "high" or "custom". If you use custom
# make sure to define the values at "- custom-values" as your convenience.
# Usually you would prefer medium/high/low.
#
# "sgh mpm-context", indicates how the staging should allot mpm contexts for
# the signature groups.  "single" indicates the use of a single context for
# all the signature group heads.  "full" indicates a mpm-context for each
# group head.  "auto" lets the engine decide the distribution of contexts
# based on the information the engine gathers on the patterns from each
# group head.
#
# The option inspection-recursion-limit is used to limit the recursive calls
# in the content inspection code.  For certain payload-sig combinations, we
# might end up taking too much time in the content inspection code.
# If the argument specified is 0, the engine uses an internally defined
# default limit.  On not specifying a value, we use no limits on the recursion.

  # If set to yes, the loading of signatures will be made after the capture

  prefilter:
    # default prefiltering setting. "mpm" only creates MPM/fast_pattern
    # engines. "auto" also sets up prefilter engines for other keywords.

# Select the multi pattern algorithm you want to run for scan/search the
# in the engine.
#
# The supported algorithms are:
# "ac"      - Aho-Corasick, default implementation
# "ac-bs"   - Aho-Corasick, reduced memory implementation
# "ac-cuda" - Aho-Corasick, CUDA implementation
# "ac-ks"   - Aho-Corasick, "Ken Steele" variant
# "hs"      - Hyperscan, available when built with Hyperscan support
#
# The default mpm-algo value of "auto" will use "hs" if Hyperscan is
# available, "ac" otherwise.
#
# The mpm you choose also decides the distribution of mpm contexts for
# signature groups, specified by the conf - "detect.sgh-mpm-context".
# Selecting "ac" as the mpm would require "detect.sgh-mpm-context"
# to be set to "single", because of ac's memory requirements, unless the
# ruleset is small enough to fit in one's memory, in which case one can
# use "full" with "ac".  Rest of the mpms can be run in "full" mode.
#
# There is also a CUDA pattern matcher (only available if Suricata was
# compiled with --enable-cuda: b2g_cuda. Make sure to update your
# max-pending-packets setting above as well if you use b2g_cuda.

  # By default Suricata creates one "detect" thread per available CPU/CPU core.
  # This setting allows controlling this behaviour. A ratio setting of 2 will
  # create 2 detect threads for each CPU/CPU core. So for a dual core CPU this
  # will result in 4 detect threads. If values below 1 are used, less threads
  # are created. So on a dual core CPU a setting of 0.5 results in 1 detect
  # thread being created. Regardless of the setting at a minimum 1 detect
  # thread will always be created.
